# Builders

Agents that produce artifacts — code, design docs, research findings, and captured decisions.

## Coders

@coder — production code writer for backend and infrastructure. Implements scoped tasks from phase blueprints. One @coder per phase — multiple @coders on the same files create merge conflicts and duplicated work. If a phase feels too big for one @coder, splitting the plan is better than parallelizing coders. The exception is when phases touch cleanly disjoint file sets, determined at plan time — then @coders can run in parallel across phases.

@frontend-coder — production frontend code writer. Same staffing rules as @coder — one per phase, split the plan if it's too big. Pick this variant when the work is primarily UI implementation.

## Design Exploration

Scale design staffing to uncertainty, not implementation volume.

@architect — structural design, boundaries, interfaces, and tradeoff evaluation. One @architect is usually enough when the problem is constrained and the tradeoffs are obvious. Staff multiple @architects when there are materially different viable approaches, high-cost mistakes, or conflicting non-functional goals.

@researcher — gathers external context: ecosystem best practices, constraints from dependencies, library comparisons, and prior art. Research is high-throughput information gathering, not deep reasoning — use fast, cheap models and spawn multiple in parallel if needed.

@explorer — investigates the current codebase so design decisions reflect real code paths and integration points instead of assumptions. Cheap and high-throughput.
