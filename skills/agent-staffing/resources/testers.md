# Testers

Different testers cover different failure modes. Verification (tests, lints, type checks via the @verifier) is the baseline. Beyond that, match testing to what the phase touches.

Testers are not limited to the @coder's described checks. Generate independent edge cases, failure modes, and boundary-condition probes based on the change itself.

## Default Lanes

@verifier — baseline for every implementation phase. Runs tests, type checks, and lints. Fixes mechanical breakage (import errors, type mismatches), reports substantive failures. Run this lane alongside @smoke-tester and @unit-tester when those lanes are warranted by the change.

@smoke-tester — default for any phase touching process boundaries, state initialization, CLI behavior, IPC, or fresh-state workflows. Unit tests and type checks verify internal correctness, but orchestration bugs — process lifecycle, file locking, IPC, fresh-state initialization — only surface when real processes run in real environments. These are exactly the bugs that ship to users because "all tests passed." When the honest test requires a temp repo, temp config, temp server, or tiny helper script, the @smoke-tester should build it in a disposable scratch environment and prove the workflow end-to-end. Do not stop at the happy path — smoke-test realistic edge cases and failure paths as a default lane. **For integration phases** (code that talks to external binaries, APIs, or wire protocols), smoke testing is the only verification that matters — you must run against the real external system and test every supported target, not just one. Explicitly report which targets were tested and which were not.

@browser-tester — default for any phase touching frontend behavior. The frontend equivalent of @smoke-tester — verifies that UI changes actually work in a real browser, not just that component tests pass. Uses `playwright-cli` for browser interaction — snapshot-driven navigation, form filling, screenshotting, console/network inspection. Visual correctness, user flows, form interactions, console errors, and accessibility. When the honest test requires fresh state, a stub API, or a temp config, build it rather than testing against whatever happens to be running. Use `playwright-cli show --annotate` when the user should see and interact with the browser directly.

@unit-tester — for tricky logic, edge cases, and regression guards. Isolated, fast, exhaustive on boundary conditions. Not every phase needs new unit tests — but when there's complex pure logic that's hard to verify end-to-end, targeted unit tests pin down the behavior. Generate edge cases independently; don't only codify claimed EARS statements handed over by the coder.

@integration-tester — the middle tier between unit and smoke. Tests that internal components compose correctly — module boundaries, coordination logic, contracts between collaborators — with fakes at external system boundaries. Use when a phase introduces new interfaces, protocols, or state machines where the composition matters more than the isolated logic. Not the right fit for pure logic (unit-tester) or real runtime behavior against live systems (smoke-tester).

**Note on gate tests during implementation:** unit and integration tests spawned at phase exit gates are temporary — deleted after verification passes. The permanent test suite is designed as a whole by @qa-lead after implementation ships, so unit/integration/e2e tests stay coherent.
