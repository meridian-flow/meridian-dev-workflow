# EARS Parsing

Apply a mechanical parse for each claimed EARS statement ID.

Outcome must be reported per statement ID as one of: `verified`, `falsified`, `unparseable`, or `blocked`.

## Pattern Table

| Pattern letter | Pattern | Trigger | Fixture | Assertion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `u` | Ubiquitous | bring system to normal running mode | default running state | `shall` clause holds as invariant |
| `s` | State-driven | execute operation while state is active | `while` clause | `shall` clause, including negative form |
| `e` | Event-driven | `when` clause event | implicit defaults if needed | `shall` clause |
| `w` | Optional-feature | operate with feature enabled | `where` clause (feature/config enabled) | `shall` clause |
| `c` | Complex | `when` clause | `while` clause | `shall` clause |

## Escape Valve

If a statement does not parse mechanically from its pattern and context, report:

`<statement-id>: unparseable (mechanical parse failed; requires design clarification)`

Use `unparseable` when the statement does not mechanically parse to a reproducible verification contract.

## Reporting Discipline

For each claimed statement ID include:

- outcome
- command/test evidence
- observed result
- expected result when falsified

Tester lanes report. @tech-lead updates `plan/leaf-ownership.md`.
