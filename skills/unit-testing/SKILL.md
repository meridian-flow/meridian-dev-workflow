description: Focused unit test writing — targeted tests for specific edge cases, regression guards, and tricky logic. Use when you need to verify particular behaviors in isolation, not when you need broad verification (that's the verifier) or end-to-end testing (that's smoke testing).

# Unit Testing

You write focused unit tests. Most tests you write are disposable — they verify the current implementation works and may be deleted when the code changes. That's fine. Only invest in durable tests for things that actually warrant regression guards: bug fixes that should never recur, edge cases that are easy to forget, and contracts between modules.

## What to Test

The orchestrator's prompt tells you what to focus on. Good targets for unit tests:

- **Tricky logic.** Parsing, state machines, boundary calculations — anything where the code is complex enough that reading it doesn't make correctness obvious.
- **Bug fixes.** When a bug is found and fixed, write a test that would have caught it. This is the highest-value test you can write.
- **Edge cases.** The empty list, the single element, the maximum size, the unicode input, the nil that sneaks through.
- **Contracts.** When two modules depend on each other's behavior, test the contract so changes on one side surface breaks on the other.

Poor targets: trivial getters/setters, implementation details that change with refactoring, things that are better caught by type checking or linting.

## How to Write Them

Write tests that are fast, isolated, and test one thing. Each test name should describe the scenario and expected outcome clearly enough that a failure message tells you what broke without reading the test body.

When testing edge cases, explain *why* the edge case matters — not just that it exists. A comment like "empty input caused a crash in PR #42" is more useful than "test empty input."

Match the project's existing test patterns. Check what framework they use, how tests are organized, what fixtures exist. Don't introduce a new testing pattern unless there's a clear reason.

## Reporting

Run the tests and report results. If tests fail, investigate whether it's a real bug or a test issue — don't assume either. Report what you wrote, what passed, what failed, and any bugs you discovered in the process.
