name: issue-tracking
description: Mirror local tracking artifacts to GitHub Issues for team visibility. Use this whenever you find bugs, unexpected behavior, deferred decisions, or backlog items during implementation, investigation, or review — anything worth tracking beyond the current work item. Also use when the orchestrator asks you to file an issue or when you've investigated a problem and determined it needs a GH issue rather than a quick fix.

# Issue Tracking

This skill assumes `__meridian-work-coordination` already defines work ownership and artifact placement. Spawn reports and work-scoped notes are the source of truth. GitHub Issues are a visibility layer — they give the team searchability, linkability, and a shared view of what was found during agent work.

If `gh` is unavailable, everything works fine with local tracking only. No errors, no warnings. Issues are a bonus, not a requirement.

## Availability Check

Before creating any issue, verify that `gh` is usable:

```bash
gh auth status 2>/dev/null && gh repo view --json name 2>/dev/null
```

If either command fails — `gh` isn't installed, authentication is missing, or the repo isn't on GitHub — skip issue creation silently. Log the finding locally and move on. The agent's job is implementation, not fighting with tooling.

## When to Create a GitHub Issue

Create an issue when you find something worth tracking that you can't or shouldn't address right now. The common situations:

**Bug found during implementation** — You hit a bug in adjacent code, but fixing it would pull you off your current phase. Log it locally *and* file an issue so it doesn't get lost.

**Unexpected behavior** — Something works but behaves surprisingly. Not broken enough to stop, but someone should investigate. These often become the bugs of next week.

**Backlog item discovered** — You notice something that needs doing (cleanup, missing test, hardcoded value) but it's out of scope for the current work item.

**Deferred design decision** — A decision came up that needs more context or broader input before it can be made. You picked a reasonable default and moved on, but the real decision is still open.

**Review finding (deferred)** — A reviewer flagged something HIGH or MEDIUM severity but agreed it's not blocking the current work. File it so it gets addressed in a future pass.

### Quick Decision Rule

- **Fix immediately** if it takes < 5 minutes and you're already in the area
- **File an issue** if it would derail your current task, requires broader context, or needs design discussion

## When NOT to Create a GitHub Issue

**CRITICAL review findings** — Fix these immediately. They don't belong in a backlog.

**Things you're fixing in this phase** — If it's part of your current work, just fix it. Don't create tracking overhead for work in progress.

**Decisions already made** — If a decision is already made and implemented, there's nothing to track. The decision is done.

## Labels

Use labels consistently so the team can filter by category. Keep every issue tagged with what it is and which work item found it.

| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `bug` | Bug found during implementation |
| `unexpected` | Surprising behavior worth investigating |
| `backlog` | Needed but out of current scope |
| `deferred` | Explicitly deferred from current work |
| `review-finding` | From code review, not blocking |
| `decision-needed` | Needs a decision before work can proceed |
| `work:<slug>` | Links issue to its originating meridian work item |
| `tech-debt` | Code quality, cleanup, refactoring needs |
| `enhancement` | New feature or improvement to existing functionality |
| `design` | Needs design discussion before implementation |
| `blocked` | Waiting on external dependency or another issue |
| `good-first-task` | Well-scoped, good for a single spawn |

These are defaults. Create project-specific labels when none of the above fit — just keep them descriptive and consistent within the repo.

See [`resources/gh-commands.md`](resources/gh-commands.md) for the full label taxonomy with colors, issue body template, and all `gh` CLI commands.

## Issue Body Structure

Every issue should answer three questions: where was this found, what is it, and what should be done about it. Use the template in [`resources/gh-commands.md`](resources/gh-commands.md) — it covers context, description, evidence, and suggested action.

## Quick Example

You're implementing step 3 of `auth-refactor` and discover that the token refresh logic silently swallows errors:

1. Note it in your spawn report or work directory — this is the source of truth
2. Check `gh` availability
3. If available, create the issue:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Bug: token refresh silently swallows errors" \
  --label "bug,work:auth-refactor" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Context
Found during: auth-refactor, step 3 (token validation)
Found by: implementer (p107)

## Description
Token refresh in `src/auth/refresh.py:45` catches all exceptions and returns
`None` instead of propagating. This masks network errors, expired credentials,
and malformed responses identically.

## Evidence
- `src/auth/refresh.py:45-52` — bare `except: return None`
- Discovered when a test passed despite invalid credentials

## Suggested Action
Replace bare except with specific exception handling. At minimum, log the
error before returning None. Ideally, distinguish retryable (network) from
permanent (invalid credentials) failures.

## Workflow Integration

Issue tracking fits naturally into the implementation and review cycles:

- **During implementation**: When you encounter something outside your current scope, log it locally first, then mirror to GitHub if available.
- **During review**: Deferred findings (HIGH/MEDIUM that aren't blocking) get both a local log entry and an issue.
- **At phase boundaries**: Quick scan of issues tagged with your `work:<slug>` gives a summary of everything discovered during that phase.
- **On completion**: Issues created during a work item serve as the handoff backlog for follow-up work.
