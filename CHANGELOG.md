# Changelog

Caveman style. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Versions before 0.0.14 in git history only.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- `CHANGELOG.md` rewritten in caveman style. Prior entries (`0.0.14`, `0.0.15`) ported, substance preserved. Convention documented in `meridian-channel/AGENTS.md`.

## [0.0.15] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- `caveman` skill (dep on [JuliusBrussee/caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman)) loaded into intermediary orchestrators: `@design-orchestrator`, `@impl-orchestrator`, `@docs-orchestrator`. Compresses coordination chatter (delegation prompts, decision logs, phase status). Each runs `caveman full` mode with agent-specific extension: decision logs, phase status, `scenarios/` seeds still record *why* in caveman style so resumed work rehydrates reasoning. Sub-agent profiles (`@architect`, `@coder`, `@code-documenter`, `@tech-writer`, etc.) stay non-caveman — design docs, code, `fs/` mirrors, user docs untouched.
- `caveman` dep declared in `mars.toml`. Pins to `v0.0.15` pick it up transitively. Pins to `v0.0.14` skip caveman entirely.

## [0.0.14] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- `@investigator`: delegation capability. Spawns `@smoke-tester`, `@explorer`, `@unit-tester`, `@internet-researcher`, or narrower `@investigator` recursively. Sandbox → `danger-full-access` for `gh`/`curl`/web tools.
- `@impl-orchestrator`: "External knowledge gaps" escalation paragraph. `@coder` stuck on lib/API behavior? Spawn `@internet-researcher`, don't burn `@coder` cycles guessing from training-data assumptions.
- `CHANGELOG.md` introduced. Keep a Changelog format (later caveman-ified, see `[Unreleased]`).

### Changed
- `@researcher` → `@internet-researcher`. New name advertises external-knowledge role, pairs with `@explorer` (internal counterpart). Body refreshed: "internet vs codebase" split explicit, no overlap with `@explorer`.
- `@investigator` refocused around diagnose → triage. Three outcomes: scoped fix, filed GH issue, documented non-issue. Dropped dual-primary reactive/backlog-sweep split. GH issue filing = first-class, not fallback.
- `@architect` "External research" section rewritten. Frames external research as grounding design in ecosystem knowledge, not training-data guessing. Calls out `@internet-researcher` vs `@explorer`.
- `@design-orchestrator` "Research what you don't know": names `@internet-researcher` as "single most-forgotten delegation in design loop." Urges heavy use.
- `agent-staffing` `builders.md`: `@internet-researcher` headlines with same framing. `@explorer` reframed as "internal counterpart."
- `README` prose + agent table updated for rename.

### Removed
- `@researcher` profile. Replaced by `@internet-researcher`.
